# Canvas LMS Course Data Downloader

This is a script for downloading the contents of course pages of a Canvas LMS instance to your machine.

It downloads all files, 'Pages', 'Announcements', and files linked to in "Modules" (since the files index for a course might throw 401 while the individual files might not).
It could be extended to download more content.

i update this whenever the script doesn't get all the things i want for a course. 

## Installation

```
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Ysgorg/canvas-lms-downloader.git

```

## Usage
